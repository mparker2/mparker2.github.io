Twitter bots are amazing. Text generating RNNs are also amazing. So I have really enjoyed the large number of silly bots which have started tweeting over the last few years. I came across a particularly good one the other day thanks to Janelle Shane, who makes a lot of excellent NN blog posts:

Its called Would You Rather bot and it actually makes polls for people to vote on based on the nonsense questions it generates. This obviously made me want to have a go.

My idea was for a "Who would win" polling twitter bot that makes up creatures or people or weird superheros, and asks who would come out on top. I managed to get about ~29k training examples just from a quick trawling of [quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Hypothetical-Battles/all_questions) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/). They included a lot of weird and wonderful questions:

    Who would win a fight between Jaime Lannister vs. the Mountain?
    Who would win this match: grown-up versions of the Land Before Time gang vs the Indominus Rex?
    Who would win, a gaboon viper or king cobra?
    Barack Obama vs Orville Redenbacher in a spoken word contest: Who would be the victor?
    Who would win in a paintball skirmish between Navy SEALs and the SAS?


This needed a bit of cleaning but once that was done I then trained the RNN using `textgenrnn`. This is an awesome little python wrapper around `keras` which makes the whole process as easy as this:

```python
whowouldwin = textgenrnn()
whowouldwin.train_from_file(
    'whowouldwin_questions.txt',
    num_epochs=25,
    gen_epochs=5
)
```

Here are some example questions generated by the network:


    Who would win this duel: Halo Love Vs. Donal Trousaurs?
    In a fight between a full grown German Cuck and a Spartan?
    Who would win this war: Gladidatizature vs. SSBWB Richards vs The Crash Soldiers?
    Who would win a fight between a pack of Xenomorphs and a full scale moose?
    Who would win in a war between Modelittan and Cyborg? How did he take on the election?
    If there was a war between the Frenchesh and the Actual Crick for Darkshark?


The twitter bot is ready to go (I used `selenium` to make it as the twitter api does not support making polls). Unfortunately I put the D.O.B. of my twitter bot as the 16th June 2018 since he was technically born last weekend, and then twitter blocked the account for being too young (should have seen that coming really). So once I have proved my true age I will post a link to the bot!
